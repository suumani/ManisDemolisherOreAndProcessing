# Mani's Demolisher Ore And Processing

Mani's Demolisher Ore And Processing is an **endgame mod** built around  
**defeating Demolishers** and turning that outcome into **rewards, production, and UPS improvements**.

The main rewards are **reduced transport volume through science pack compression**  
and the **Demolin ore production and circulation lines** that support it.

This mod does **not** add new weapons.  
Instead, it focuses on refining your factory through **production structures, logistics, and compression**.

---

## What this mod adds
- A new **Demolin Ore** series obtained from Demolishers
- Refining, breeding, and circulation systems  
  (uranium-style centrifuge breeding and wastewater recovery routes)
- Smelting → packaging → **science pack compression**  
  (for transportation, storage, and UPS improvement)
- Boss Science Pack production  
  (Egg route / Wood route)

## Dependencies
This mod is designed with the following dependencies in mind:

- **Required**: Manis_lib (shared utilities)
- **Required**: Manis_definitions (Demolisher definitions)
- **Strongly recommended**: Mani's Boss Demolisher (boss spawn triggers)

> This mod will still function without Mani's Boss Demolisher installed,  
> but elements that rely on higher-tier Demolin ores  
> (speed / gigantic / king) will be intentionally unavailable.
