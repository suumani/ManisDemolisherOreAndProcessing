# Mani's Demolisher Ore And Processing

Mani's Demolisher Ore And Processing is an endgame content mod that starts from **demolisher kills**
and provides **rewards, production chains, and UPS improvements**.

This mod is not about adding new weapons.
It focuses on factory structure, logistics, and compression as the “endgame”.

## What this mod adds
- “Demolin ore” tiers obtained from demolishers
- Refining, breeding/looping (centrifuge-style breeding and wastewater recovery)
- Smelting → packaging materials → science pack compression (transport/storage/UPS)
- Boss science pack production (two routes: egg-based / wood-based)

- Manis_lib
- Manis_definitions
- Mani's Boss Demolisher
